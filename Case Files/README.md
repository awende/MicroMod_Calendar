This folder contains the 3D models used for the MicroMod Calendar case. The top of the case provides recesses for the switches' housing, and top mounted parts, along with cutouts for the USB-C connector, LCD, LEDs, and buttons. The bottom case has a cutout for the USB-C connector, and standoff holes for 4-40 hardware. Hardware isn't needed though as the fit for the Input and Display board is nicely sandwiched between the top and bottom case to hold it in place.

With a little pressure, the 5-way switch cap is held on securely, but round actuators for the button switch caps were a bit tricky to fit correctly. In my prints the recess for the button switches were a bit too tight and I had to hold them with pliers and drill them out. The button switch actuators are 0.080" in diamter, and a 0.076" drill provided a good snug fit.
